üìã MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open browser console to see debug logs
2. Navigate to Step 1 and fill out personal information
3. Navigate to Step 2 and make selections:
   - Select a University
   - Select a Major  
   - Select an Admission Method
   - Watch console logs for UNIVERSITY_EFFECT and ADMISSION_METHOD_EFFECT
4. Navigate to Step 3 (this was where the bug occurred)
   - Check console logs for any "üö® CRITICAL" messages
   - Verify allStepsData still contains admissionMethodId
5. Attempt to submit the form
   - Should succeed without "Ph∆∞∆°ng th·ª©c x√©t tuy·ªÉn ch∆∞a ch·ªçn" error

üêõ BEFORE FIX (bug behavior):
- Effects would clear admissionMethodId during step transitions
- Form submission would fail with validation error
- allStepsData.applicationChoice.admissionMethodId would be undefined

‚úÖ AFTER FIX (expected behavior):  
- Effects only clear when user actually changes selections
- admissionMethodId preserved throughout flow
- Form submission succeeds
- All data sources remain synchronized
